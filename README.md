<!-- # 🤖 Decentralized AI Bot Marketplace on Sei

## 🔍 Problem

AI is transforming the world, but:
- **Access to AI models is centralized** — controlled by a few tech giants.
- **Developers struggle to monetize AI bots** without relying on web2 platforms.
- **Users have no transparency** on how AI decisions are made or used.
- **AI model usage data is siloed**, making it impossible to verify ownership, performance, or royalties.

---

## 💡 Solution: A Decentralized AI Bot Marketplace

We present a **Web3 platform for publishing, accessing, and monetizing AI agents** using smart contracts on the Sei blockchain. 

- 🧠 Developers can upload their AI agents and earn usage-based rewards.
- 💼 Users can discover, pay, and use AI bots with full on-chain transparency.
- 🔐 All interactions, ratings, and ownership are immutably recorded on Sei.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🛒 **AI Bot Store**: Search and discover decentralized AI agents.
- 🔗 **Smart Contract-Driven Access**: Pay-per-use or subscription models via smart contracts.
- 🧾 **On-Chain Usage Logs**: Immutable and verifiable records of each bot’s usage and performance.
- 🎓 **Reputation System**: Bots gain credibility via community ratings stored on-chain.
- 🪙 **NFT Licensing** *(optional)*: Tokenized ownership of AI bots for trading/licensing.

# 🤖 Decentralized AI Bot Rental Platform on Sei  
### Empowering AI creators & users through crypto-native access

---

## 🔍 The Problem  

AI is transforming industries, but today’s access model is broken:

- 🏦 Centralized platforms dominate AI access and monetization.
- 💡 Independent developers have limited options to earn from their AI agents.
- 🔒 There’s no **transparent**, **decentralized**, or **crypto-native** way for users to discover and rent AI tools.

---

## 💡 The Solution: Rent AI Agents via $SEI — No Smart Contracts Needed  

Introducing a **decentralized AI bot rental marketplace** built on the **Sei blockchain**.

- 🧠 Developers list their AI agents for rent.
- 💸 Users send $SEI directly to developers to unlock access.
- 🔓 Off-chain verification grants access without needing smart contracts.

> ⚡ Simple. Fast. Crypto-native.

---

## ⚙️ MVP Features  

- 🛍 **AI Bot Marketplace**: Discover chatbots, automation tools, content generators, and more.  
- 💰 **Direct $SEI Payments**: Rent bots via peer-to-peer token transfers.  
- 🔐 **Secure Access Granting**: Access is manually or automatically verified after payment.  
- 🧠 **Off-Chain Execution**: Bots run off-chain (e.g., APIs or cloud services) for fast and cost-effective performance.

---

## 🔮 What’s Next  

Future-proofing the platform with:

- 📊 **On-Chain Usage Logging**: Transparently track bot interactions.
- 🪪 **NFT-Based Licensing**: Turn bots into tradable digital assets.
- ⛓️ **Smart Contract Add-ons**: Enable subscriptions and microtransactions.
- 🌟 **Reputation System**: Let users review and rate bots.
- 🧾 **Royalty Engine**: Reward developers for downstream usage or resale.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Frontend**: React + Sei wallet integration  
- **Payments**: Direct $SEI transfers (no smart contracts needed)  
- **Bot Hosting**: Off-chain (cloud servers, APIs, containers)  
- **Blockchain**: Sei Layer 1  

---

## 🔄 How It Works (MVP Flow)  

1. User browses AI bots in the marketplace.  
2. Selects a bot and sends $SEI to the bot's wallet address.  
3. Platform detects payment (manually or via automation).  
4. User receives temporary access credentials (API key, token, or app link).  
5. User interacts with the bot directly via UI or API.

---

## 📅 Roadmap  

- ✅ Peer-to-peer $SEI payment for access  
- 🔄 Auto access unlock via wallet verification  
- 📊 Usage logs on-chain (coming soon)  
- 🪪 NFT-based agent licensing & resale rights (future)  
- ⛓️ Smart contract subscription support (future)


## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
