# 🤖 Decentralized AI Bot Marketplace on Sei

## 🔍 Problem

AI is transforming the world, but:
- **Access to AI models is centralized** — controlled by a few tech giants.
- **Developers struggle to monetize AI bots** without relying on web2 platforms.
- **Users have no transparency** on how AI decisions are made or used.
- **AI model usage data is siloed**, making it impossible to verify ownership, performance, or royalties.

---

We present a **Web3 platform for publishing, accessing, and monetizing AI agents** using smart contracts on the Sei blockchain. 

- 🧠 Developers can upload their AI agents and earn usage-based rewards.
- 💼 Users can discover, pay, and use AI bots with full on-chain transparency.
- 🔐 All interactions, ratings, and ownership are immutably recorded on Sei.
