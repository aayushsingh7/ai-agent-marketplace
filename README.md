## 🔍 1. The Problem  

The AI revolution is accelerating — but access remains monopolized and fragmented:

- 🏦 Centralized tech giants dominate AI distribution and monetization  
- 🚫 Indie developers struggle to profit or gain visibility for their innovations  
- 🔐 No open, decentralized, or crypto-native framework exists to truly **own**, **trade**, or **access** AI

> 🌐 We're stuck in a Web2 paradigm trying to build Web3 intelligence.

<br>

## 💡 2. The Solution  

**SeiAgent** – A decentralized platform where users can **rent, own, or trade AI agents** using $SEI on the Sei blockchain:

- 💳 **Smart contract-based credit system** lets users access AI (e.g., APIs, generators, models)  
- 🧠 Developers mint their AI agents as **NFTs**, enabling tradable, ownable access  
- 🔐 Agent access is validated **on-chain** while executions happen **off-chain** for performance  

> ⚡ Own it. Rent it. Use it. Remint it — all on-chain.

## 🚀 3. Features  

- 🛍️ **AI Agent Marketplace** – Discover and rent specialized AI agents for different tasks  
- 🧠 **NFT Agent Ownership** – Buy and trade AI agents as NFTs with exclusive usage rights   
- 💳 **Credit-Based Usage** – Use credits (via smart contracts) to access agents without full ownership  
- 🔐 **On-Chain Access Control** – Secure validation, decentralized trust  
- ⚙️ **Off-Chain Execution** – Efficient, scalable performance via external services

   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `client/` directory:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:4000/api/v1"
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### 🛠️ 8.4 Setting Up the Backend (Server)

1. Navigate to the server folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:
   ```env
   JWT_SECRET=YOUR_JWT_SECRET_HERE
   MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_URI_HERE
   MINTER_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_MINTER_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE  # Metamask private key to mint on behalf of users
   RPC_URL=https://evm-rpc-testnet.sei-apis.com
